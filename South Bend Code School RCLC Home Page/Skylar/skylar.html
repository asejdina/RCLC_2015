   <h1>About Me</h1>
  </div>
  <p> My name is Skylar.</p>
  <p> I like videogames and playing on the computer.</p>
  <p> Also, I like to ride bikes and play other sports.</p>
  <p> I'm smart and love to read.</p>
 <h2> Issues I care about.</h2>
  <p> Some issues I care about are poverty, prices on food and gas, and pollution.</p>
  <p> Poverty is something we need to work on because some people die from it.</p>
  <p> Pollution is very bad for the environment.</p>
  <p> It kills animals and affects the air. For example, global warming is one of the effects of pollution.</p>
  <p> The last problem, food and gas prices, is that they are too high and need to be lowered.</p>
  <p> These are issues that I care about because they affect me and others.</p>
 <h1> What technology means to me.</p>
   <p>With code, you can become <strong>superman</strong></p>
