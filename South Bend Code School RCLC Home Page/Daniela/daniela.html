    <h3>about me</h3>
    <p>I'm Daniela</p>
    <p>My name is Daniela.I have a twin sister and a little sister. I'm the</p>
    <p>oldest, but everybody thinks my twin sister is the oldest. I only</p>
    <p>have one pet and that's my dog, Dingo. The only sport I do is track.</p>
    <p>I was born on Dec.26 (after Christmas). I also like to go to places </p>
    <p>with my friends and have fun.</p>
  </div>


<p>I will tell you some of the issues that I care about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Too many people are homeless.</li>
  <li>Some of the streets have trash. People should start to take care of the streets.</li>
  <li>Another thing that I care about is that some people don't have food to eat and so they are hungry.</li>
</ul>
