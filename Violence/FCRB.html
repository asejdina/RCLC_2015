      <h1>BreAu`na Dotson</h1>
      <p>Violence killed my oldest brother in 2012. You never realize how much violence effects your life and commnity
            until violence comes into your life. Violence is something that happens everyday in our community. It impacts
            pepole and other people`s family. Violence is something that can change, and people have the power to change.
            Everyday is a new day without my older brother. It`s hard to know someone could do this to someone that you love.
            Never thought I would say R.I.P Big Brother but i have to and violence is all because of it. So we need to change
            our minds about violence and stop the violence in South Bend.
