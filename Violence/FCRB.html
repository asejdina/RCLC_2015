          <p>I think violence needs to be stopped because they want all the black people dead. But they nedd out soul food.
                We need to do something about this fast.

          <p>Violence killed my oldest brother in 2012. You never realize how much violence effects your life and commnity
                until violence comes into your life. Violence is something that happens everyday in our community. It impacts
                pepole and other people`s family. Violence is something that can change, and people have the power to change.
                Everyday is a new day without my older brother. It`s hard to know someone could do this to someone that you love.
                Never thought I would say R.I.P Big Brother but i have to and violence is all because of it. So we need to change
                our minds about violence and stop the violence in South Bend.

          <p>I lost a cousin to violence in 2010. He was found by his mom at his home and for about two years they did not know
                 who was responsible for his death. Even though violence has aleays been a problem I never knew how bad it wa until i was personally
                 affected. Once a homicide takes place everyone involved looses someone. The victim family looses a loved one and the person that
                 killed the victim will be punished by law which leaves their family without their loved one. Thats why I think violence needs to sease
                 permanently.

          <p>I think violence starts from peer pressure. When kids are bullied into fighting they try to do the right think by avoiding it.
                 However, the bullies threaten them and they give into the peer pressure. I think if they ban guns from South Bend the community
                 will be a lot safer.
